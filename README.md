# Manufacturing Operations KPI Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project highlights a simulated version of a **Power BI dashboard** I developed during my internship at **Ashirvad by Aliaxis**, a leading manufacturing organization.  
The dashboard was designed to provide plant-wide visibility of operational performance, enabling the **Operational Excellence** team to monitor and improve key KPIs across departments including **Production, Maintenance, Safety, Quality, and HR**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The dashboard served as a centralized performance monitoring tool, allowing leadership and departmental managers to make data‑driven decisions through:

- ✅ Department-wise safety and incident tracking  
- ✅ Machine-wise production and rejection analysis (Extrusion & Injection Molding)  
- ✅ Shift-wise and date-wise downtime reporting  
- ✅ Manpower utilization metrics per metric ton produced  
- ✅ Energy consumption and maintenance insights  
- ✅ Complaint type categorization and rejection analysis

## ✨ Key Features

- 📊 Dynamic KPI cards for real-time monitoring  
- 📈 Interactive trend charts for productivity, rejection rates, and downtime  
- ⚙️ Machine and shift-level performance benchmarking  
- 🛡️ Department-wise safety and near-miss incident reporting  
- 🔍 Drill-down capability for analyzing rejection causes by product line and machine  
- 🗂️ Slicers and page navigation for intuitive exploration of data

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- **Power BI Desktop** – data modeling and visualization  
- **Power Query** – data transformation and cleaning  
- **DAX** – calculated measures (*Rejection %*, *OEE*, *AU%*)  
- **Slicers & Filters** – department, shift, product, and time-based analysis  
- **Multi-page navigation** – structured dashboard sections

## 📐 Key Metrics Monitored

- **OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness):** Availability × Performance × Quality  
- **AU% (Available Utilization):** Ratio of available production time to scheduled time  
- **Rejection %:** Defective output as a percentage of total production  
- **MD/MT (Man-days per Metric Ton):** Manpower efficiency per metric ton of output  
- **Near Miss:** Potential safety incidents avoided  
- **HMS (Hazard Management System):** Tracking and resolution of safety hazards  
- **Complaint Types:** Categorization of customer/internal complaints (*Visual Not OK*, *Impact Test Fail*, etc.)  
- **Downtime Reasons:** Root causes (*Screw cooling issues*, *Feeder problems*, *Mold maintenance*, etc.)  
- **Energy Consumption (kWh/kg):** Power consumption per unit output
