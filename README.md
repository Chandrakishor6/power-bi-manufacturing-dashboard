A power BI dashboard for monitoring manufacturing KPIs, built during my internship at Ashirvad by Aliaxis. Screenshots provided for demonstration

# 🏭 Manufacturing Operations Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project showcases a simulated version of a Power BI dashboard I created during my internship at a leading manufacturing company. The dashboard was built to enhance visibility of plant-wide performance metrics, helping the Operational Excellence team monitor key KPIs across departments such as **Production, Maintenance, Safety, Quality, and HR**.

> 📌 **Disclaimer**: Due to confidentiality agreements, only screenshots are provided. Actual data and .pbix files are not shared.


## 📊 Project Summary

The dashboard enables leadership to make data-driven decisions by providing insights into:

- Department-wise incident tracking 
- Machine-wise production and rejection analysis (Extrusion & Injection Molding)
- Shift and date-wise downtime analysis
- Manpower utilization per metric ton produced
- Energy consumption and maintenance breakdowns
- Complaint types and rejection categories


## 🚀 Key Features

- Real-time KPI tracking with card visuals
- Trend charts for productivity, rejection, and downtime
- Machine and shift performance benchmarking
- Department-wise safety incident reporting
- Drill-down into rejection causes by product line and machine

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques

- **Power BI Desktop** for visualization
- **Power Query** for data transformation and cleaning
- **DAX** for calculated fields (e.g., Rejection %, OEE, AU%)
- **Slicers** for filtering by department, shift, product, and time
- **Page navigation** for multi-section dashboard
